				<p class="B--CT-">THE BOOK HUNTER</p>
				<p class="Text--1st-on-CO"><span class="drop-cap">I</span><span class="CO-SC">N THE WINTER</span> of 1417, Poggio Bracciolini rode through the wooded hills and valleys of southern Germany toward his distant destination, a monastery reputed to have a cache of old manuscripts. As must have been immediately apparent to the villagers looking out at him from the doors of their huts, the man was a stranger. <a id="Slight-of-build"/><a href="TheSwerve-19.html#x14">Slight of build</a> and clean-shaven,<a id="GBS.0020.02"/> he would probably have been modestly dressed in a well-made but simple tunic and cloak. That he was not country-bred was clear, and yet he did not resemble any of the city and court dwellers whom the locals would have been accustomed to glimpse from time to time. Unarmed and unprotected by a clanging suit of armor, he was certainly not a Teutonic knight—one stout blow from a raw-boned yokel’s<a id="GBS.0020.03"/> club would have easily felled him. Though he did not seem to be poor, he had none of the familiar signs of wealth and status: he was not a courtier, with gorgeous clothes and perfumed hair worn in long lovelocks, nor was he a nobleman out hunting and hawking. And, as was plain from his clothes and the cut of his hair, he was not a priest or a monk.</p>
				<p class="Text">Southern Germany at the time was prosperous.<a id="GBS.0020.04"/> The catastrophic Thirty Years’ War that would ravage the countryside and shatter whole cities in the region lay far in the future, as did the horrors of our own time that destroyed much of what had survived from this period. In addition to knights, courtiers, and nobles, other men of substance busily traveled the rutted, hard-packed roads. Ravensburg, near Constance, was involved in the linen<a id="GBS.0020.05"/> trade and had recently begun to produce paper. Ulm, on the left bank of the Danube, was a flourishing center of manufacture and commerce, as were Heidenheim, Aalen, beautiful Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and still more beautiful Würzburg. Burghers, wool brokers, leather and cloth merchants, vintners and brewers, craftsmen and their apprentices, as well as diplomats, bankers, and tax collectors, all<a id="GBS.0021.01"/> were familiar sights. But Poggio still did not fit.</p>
				<p class="Text"><span>There were less prosperous figures too—journeymen, tinkers, knife-sharpeners, and others whose trades kept them on the move; pilgrims on their way to shrines where they could worship in the presence of a fragment of a saint’s bone or a drop of sacred blood; jugglers, fortune-tellers, hawkers, acrobats and mimes traveling from village to<a id="GBS.0021.02"/> village; runaways, vagabonds, and petty thieves. And there were the Jews, with the conical hats and the yellow badges that the Christian authorities forced them to wear, so that they could be easily identified as objects of contempt and hatred. Poggio was certainly none of these.</span></p>
				<p class="Text">To those who watched him pass, he must in fact have been a baffling figure. Most people at the time signaled their<a id="GBS.0021.03"/> identities, their place in the hierarchical social system, in visible signs that everyone could read, like the indelible stains on a dyer’s hands. Poggio was barely legible. An isolated individual, considered outside the structures of family and occupation, made very little sense. What mattered was what you belonged to or even whom you belonged to. The little couplet Alexander Pope mockingly<a id="GBS.0021.04"/> wrote in the eighteenth century, to put on one of the queen’s little pugs, could have applied in earnest in the world that Poggio inhabited:</p>
				<p class="PTY--1st">I am his Highness’ dog at Kew;</p>
				<p class="PTY--last">Pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?</p>
				<p class="Text-FL">The household, the kinship network, the guild, the corporation—these were the building blocks of personhood. Independence and self-reliance had no cultural purchase; indeed,<a id="GBS.0021.05"/> they could scarcely be conceived, let alone prized. Identity came with a precise, well-understood place in a chain of command and obedience.</p>
				<p class="Text">To attempt to break the chain was folly. An impertinent gesture—a refusal to bow or kneel or uncover one’s head to the appropriate person—could lead to one’s nose being slit or one’s neck broken. And what, after all, was the point? It was not as if there<a id="GBS.0022.01"/> were any coherent alternatives, certainly not one articulated by the Church or the court or the town oligarchs. The best course was humbly to accept the identity to which destiny assigned you: the ploughman needed only to know how to plough, the weaver to weave, the monk to pray. It was possible, of course, to be better or worse at any of these things; the society in which Poggio found himself<a id="GBS.0022.02"/> acknowledged and, to a considerable degree, rewarded unusual skill. But to prize a person for some ineffable individuality or for many-sidedness or for intense curiosity was virtually unheard of. <a id="Indeed--curiosity-was-said"/><a href="TheSwerve-19.html#x16">Indeed, curiosity was said</a> by the Church to be a mortal sin. To indulge it was to risk an eternity in hell.</p>
				<p class="Text">Who was Poggio, then? Why did he not proclaim his identity on his back, the way decent<a id="GBS.0022.03"/> folks were accustomed to do? He wore no insignia and carried no bundles of merchandise. He had the self-assured air of someone accustomed to the society of the great, but he himself was evidently a figure of no great consequence. Everyone knew what such an important person looked like, for this was a society of retainers and armed guards and liveried servants. The stranger, simply attired, rode in<a id="GBS.0022.04"/> the company of a single companion. When they paused at inns, the companion, who appeared to be an assistant or servant, did the ordering; when the master spoke, it became clear that he knew little or no German and that his native language was Italian.</p>
				<p class="Text">If he had tried to explain to an inquisitive person what he was up to, the mystery of his identity would only have deepened. In a culture with<a id="GBS.0022.05"/> very limited literacy, to be interested in books was already an oddity. And how could Poggio have accounted for the still odder nature of his particular interests? He was not in search of books of hours or missals or hymnals whose exquisite illuminations and splendid bindings made manifest their value even to the illiterate. These books, some of them jewel-encrusted and edged with gold, were often<a id="GBS.0023.01"/> locked in special boxes or chained to lecterns and shelves, so that light-fingered readers could not make off with them. But they held no special appeal for Poggio. Nor was he drawn to the theological, medical, or legal tomes that were the prestigious tools of the professional elites. Such books had a power to impress and intimidate even those who could not read them. They had a social magic,<a id="GBS.0023.02"/> of the kind associated for the most part with unpleasant events: a lawsuit, a painful swelling in the groin, an accusation of witchcraft or heresy. An ordinary person would have grasped that volumes of this kind had teeth and claws and hence have understood why a clever person might hunt them. But here again Poggio’s indifference was baffling.</p>
				<p class="Text">The stranger was going to a monastery, but he<a id="GBS.0023.03"/> was not a priest or a theologian or an inquisitor, and he was not looking for prayer books. He was after old manuscripts, many of them moldy, worm-eaten, and all but indecipherable even to the best-trained readers. If the sheets of parchment on which such books were written were still intact, they had a certain cash value, since they could be carefully scraped clean with knives, smoothed with talcum<a id="GBS.0023.04"/> powder, and written over anew. But Poggio was not in the parchment-buying business, and he actually loathed those who scratched off the old letters. He wanted to see what was written on them, even if the writing was crabbed and difficult, and he was most interested in manuscripts that were four or five hundred years old, going back then to the tenth century or even earlier.</p>
				<p class="Text">To all but a handful<a id="GBS.0023.05"/> of people in Germany, this quest, had Poggio tried to articulate it, would have seemed weird. And it would have seemed weirder still if Poggio had gone on to explain that he was not in fact at all interested in what was written four or five hundred years ago. He despised that time and regarded it as a sink of superstition and ignorance. What he really hoped to find were words that had nothing<a id="GBS.0024.01"/> to do with the moment in which they were written down on the old parchment, words that were in the best pos<span>sible case uncontaminated by the mental universe of the lowly scribe </span>who copied them. That scribe, Poggio hoped, was dutifully and accurately copying a still older parchment, one made by yet another scribe whose humble life was equally of no particular consequence to the book hunter except<a id="GBS.0024.02"/> insofar as it left behind this trace. If the nearly miraculous run of good fortune held, the earlier manuscript, long vanished into dust, was in turn a faithful copy of a more ancient manuscript, and that manuscript a copy of yet another. Now at last for Poggio the quarry became exciting, and the hunter’s heart in his breast beat faster. The trail was leading him back to Rome, not the contemporary<a id="GBS.0024.03"/> Rome of the corrupt papal court, intrigues, political debility, and periodic outbreaks of bubonic plague, but the Rome of the Forum and the Senate House and a Latin language whose crystalline beauty filled him with wonder and the longing for a lost world.</p>
				<p class="Text">What could any of this mean to anyone who had his feet on the ground in southern Germany in 1417? Listening to Poggio, a superstitious<a id="GBS.0024.04"/> man might have suspected a particular type of sorcery, bibliomancy; a more sophisticated man might have diagnosed a psychological obsession, bibliomania; a pious man might have wondered why any sound soul would feel a passionate attraction for the time before the Saviour brought the promise of redemption to the benighted pagans. And all would have asked the obvious question: whom does this man serve?</p><a id="GBS.0024.05"/>
				<p class="Text">Poggio himself might have been hard-pressed for an answer. He had until recently served the pope, as he had served a succession of earlier Roman pontiffs. His occupation was <span class="ITALIC">scriptor</span>, that is, a skilled writer of official documents in the papal bureaucracy, and, through adroitness and cunning, he had risen to the coveted position of apostolic secretary. He was on hand then to write down the<a id="GBS.0025.01"/> pope’s words, record his sovereign decisions, craft in elegant Latin his extensive international correspondence. In a formal court setting, in which physical proximity to the absolute ruler was a key asset, Poggio was a man of importance. He listened while the pope whispered something in his ear; he whispered something back; he knew the meaning of the pope’s smiles and frowns. He had access, as<a id="GBS.0025.02"/> the very word “secretary” suggests, to the pope’s secrets. And this pope had a great many secrets.</p>
				<p class="Text">But at the time that Poggio was riding off in search of ancient manuscripts, he was no longer apostolic secretary. He had not displeased his master, the pope, and that master was still alive. But everything had changed. The pope Poggio had served and before whom the faithful (and the less than<a id="GBS.0025.03"/> faithful) had trembled was at that moment in the winter of 1417 sitting in an imperial prison in Heidelberg. Stripped of his title, his name, his power, and his dignity, he had been publicly disgraced, condemned by the princes of his own church. The “holy and infallible” General Council of Constance declared that by <a id="his--detestable-and-unseemly-life-"/><a href="TheSwerve-19.html#x19">his “detestable and unseemly life”</a> he had brought scandal on the Church and on<a id="GBS.0025.04"/> Christendom, and that he was unfit to remain in his exalted office. Accordingly, the council released all believers from fidelity and obedience to him; indeed, it was now forbidden to call him pope or to obey him. In the long history of the Church, with its impressive share of scandals, little like this had happened before—and nothing like it has happened since.</p>
				<p class="Text"><span>The deposed pope was not there<a id="GBS.0025.05"/> in person, but Poggio, his erstwhile apostolic secretary, may have been present when the archbishop of Riga handed the papal seal to a goldsmith, who solemnly broke it in pieces, along with the papal arms. All of the ex-pope’s servants were formally dismissed, and his correspondence—the correspondence that Poggio had been instrumental in  managing—was officially terminated. The pope who had called<a id="GBS.0026.01"/> himself John XXIII no longer existed; the man who had borne that title was now once again what he had been christened, Baldassare Cossa. And Poggio was now a masterless man.</span></p>
				<p class="Text">To be masterless in the early fifteenth century was for most men an unenviable, even dangerous state. Villages and towns looked with suspicion on itinerants; vagrants were whipped and branded; and on lonely paths in a<a id="GBS.0026.02"/> largely unpoliced world the unprotected were exceedingly vulnerable. Of course, Poggio was hardly a vagrant. Sophisticated and highly skilled, he had long moved in the circles of the great. The armed guards at the Vatican and the Castel St. Angelo let him pass through the gates without a word of inquiry, and important suitors to the papal court tried to catch his eye. He had direct access to an absolute<a id="GBS.0026.03"/> ruler, the wealthy and cunning master of enormous territories, who also claimed to be the spiritual master of all of Western Christendom. In the private chambers of palaces, as in the papal court itself, the apostolic secretary Poggio was a familiar presence, exchanging jokes with bejeweled cardinals, chatting with ambassadors, and drinking fine wine from cups of crystal and gold. In Florence<a id="GBS.0026.04"/> he had been befriended by some of the most powerful figures in the Signoria, the city’s ruling body, and he had a distinguished circle of friends.</p>
				<p class="Text">But Poggio was not in Rome or Florence. He was in Germany, and the pope he had followed to the city of Constance was in prison. The enemies of John XXIII had triumphed and were now in control. Doors that had once been open to Poggio were firmly<a id="GBS.0026.05"/> shut. And suitors eager for a favor—a  dispensation, a legal ruling, a lucrative position for themselves or their relatives—who had paid court to the secretary as a means to pay court to his master were all looking elsewhere. Poggio’s income abruptly ceased.</p>
				<p class="Text">That income had been considerable. Scriptors received no fixed stipend, but they were permitted to charge fees for executing documents<a id="GBS.0027.01"/> and obtaining what were called “concessions of grace,” that is, legal favors in matters that required some technical correction or exception granted orally or in writing by the pope. And, of course, there were other, less official fees that would privately flow to someone who had the pope’s ear. In the mid-fifteenth century, the income for a secretary was 250 to 300 florins annually, and an entrepreneurial<a id="GBS.0027.02"/> spirit could make much more. At the end of a twelve-year period in this office, Poggio’s colleague <a id="George-of-Trebizond-had-salted"/><a href="TheSwerve-19.html#x21">George of Trebizond had salted</a> away over 4,000 florins in Roman banks, along with handsome investments in real estate.</p>
				<p class="Text">In his letters to friends Poggio claimed throughout his life that he was neither ambitious nor greedy. He wrote a celebrated essay attacking avarice as one of the most hateful<a id="GBS.0027.03"/> of human vices, and he excoriated the greed of hypocritical monks, unscrupulous princes, and grasping merchants. It would be foolish, of course, to take such professions at face value: there is ample evidence from later in his career, when he managed to return to the papal court, that Poggio used his office to make money hand over fist. <a id="By-the-1450s"/><a href="TheSwerve-19.html#x22">By the 1450s</a>, along with a family <span class="ITALIC">palazzo </span>and a country estate,<a id="GBS.0027.04"/> he had managed to acquire several farms, nineteen separate pieces of land, and two houses in Florence, and he had also made very large deposits in banking and business houses.</p>
				<p class="Text">But this prosperity lay decades in the future. An official inventory (called a <span class="ITALIC">catasto</span>) compiled in 1427 by tax officials indicated that Poggio had fairly modest means. And a decade earlier, at the time that John XXIII<a id="GBS.0027.05"/> was deposed, he almost certainly had far less. Indeed, his later acquisitiveness may have been a reaction to the memory of those long months, stretching into several lean years, when he found himself in a strange land without a position or an income and with very few resources on which to fall back. In the winter of 1417, when he rode through the South German countryside, Poggio had little or<a id="GBS.0028.01"/> no idea where his next florins would come from.</p>
				<p class="Text">It is all the more striking that <a id="in-this-difficult-period"/><a href="TheSwerve-19.html#x22-29">in this difficult period</a> Poggio did not quickly find a new position or make haste to return to Italy. What he did instead was to go book-hunting.</p>
