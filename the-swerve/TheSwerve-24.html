				<p class="praisebody"><span class="Notes-lead-in">“</span><span class="Italic">The Swerve</span><span class="Notes-lead-in"> is an adventure story about scholarship that locates the foundations of modern secular, scientific thought in the brilliance and heroism of our intellectual forbears.”</span></p>

				<p class="praisebody"><span class="Notes-lead-in">“Greenblatt brilliantly ushers readers into this world, which is at once recognizable and wholly foreign.<a id="GBS.0380.02"/> He has an evocative hand with description and a liquid way of introducing supporting players who soon become principals: Democritus, Epicurius, scribe monks, Thomas More, Giordano Bruno, Montaigne and Darwin, to name just a few. More wonderfully illuminating Renaissance history from a master scholar and historian.”</span></p>

Another triumph for Stephen Greenblatt.”</span></p>
