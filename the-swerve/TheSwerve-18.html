				<p class="Text--1st-on-CO"><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="CO-SC">HE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER </span>whose work gave rise to the story that I trace in these pages believed that life’s highest end was pleasure, and he took particular pleasure in the community of his friends. It is only fitting then that I acknowledge the rich and sustaining network of friends and colleagues who have enhanced the writing of this book. Over the course<a id="GBS.0261.02"/> of a year at the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin I spent many pleasurable hours discussing Lucretius with the late Bernard Williams, whose marvelous intelligence illuminated everything that it touched. And some years later at the same wonderful Berlin institution I participated in an extraordinary Lucretius reading group that gave me the critical impetus I needed. Generously guided by two philosophers,<a id="GBS.0261.03"/> Christoph Horn and Christof Rapp, the group, which included Horst Bredekamp, Susan James, Reinhard Meyer-Kalkus, Quentin Skinner, and Ramie Targoff, along with more occasional visitors, worked its way with exemplary care and contentiousness through the poem.</p>
				<p class="Text">A second wonderful institution—the American Academy in Rome—provided the perfect setting for the bulk of the book’s writing: Nowhere<a id="GBS.0261.04"/> else in my experience is the precious opportunity to sit quietly and work so exquisitely braided together with Epicurean pleasure. To the Academy’s director, Carmela Vircillo Franklin, and its capable staff, along with a host of fellows and visitors, I owe a deep debt of gratitude. My agent, Jill Kneerim, and my editor, Alane Salierno Mason, have been extraordinarily helpful, generous, and acute<a id="GBS.0261.05"/> readers. Among the many others who have given me advice and assistance, I want to single out Albert Ascoli, Homi Bhabha, Alison Brown, Gene Brucker, Joseph Connors, Brian Cummings, Trevor Dadson, Kenneth Gouwens, Jeffrey Hamburger, James Hankins, Philip Hardie, Bernard Jussen, Joseph Koerner, Thomas Laqueur, George Logan, David Norbrook, William O’Connell, Robert Pinsky, Oliver Primavesi, Steven Shapin,<a id="GBS.0262.01"/> Marcello Simonetta, James Simpson, Pippa Skotnes, Nick Wilding, and David Wootton.</p>
				<p class="Text">My students and colleagues at Harvard have been a source of constant intellectual stimulation and challenge, and the stupendous library resources of this university have never ceased to amaze me. I owe particular thanks for research assistance to Christine Barrett, Rebecca Cook, Shawon Kinew, Ada Palmer, and<a id="GBS.0262.02"/> Benjamin Woodring.</p>
				<p class="Text">My deepest debt of gratitude—for wise advice and for inexhaustible pleasure—is to my wife, Ramie Targoff.</p>
